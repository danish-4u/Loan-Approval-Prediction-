Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to automate and optimize the loan approval process using a machine learning classification model. The model predicts whether a loan will be approved based on applicant information such as credit history, income, education, and loan amount.

#Project Overview

- Project Title: Loan Approval Prediction  
- Intern Name: Md Danish Iqbal  
- Intern ID: 2321  
- Organization: Vaidsys Technologies  
- Submission Date: 22nd July 2025  

#Objectives

- Predict loan approval status using ML
- Identify key features influencing decisions
- Improve the accuracy and efficiency of the loan screening process

#Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
  
#Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle â€“ Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset)
- Attributes: Gender, Education, Credit History, LoanAmount, ApplicantIncome, etc.

#Implementation Steps

1. Data Cleaning (handling nulls, outliers)
2. Categorical Encoding
3. Train/Test Split (80/20)
4. Model Training using Random Forest Classifier
5. Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report
6. Feature Importance Visualization

#Results

- Model Used: Random Forest Classifier
- Accuracy Achieved: 85%
- Top Influencing Features:
  1. Credit History
  2. Applicant Income
  3. Loan Amount
     
#Output Samples

- Confusion Matrix  
- Feature Importance Bar Chart  
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
